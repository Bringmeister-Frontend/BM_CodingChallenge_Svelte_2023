# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Run the project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start local development version
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab, project should be available on http://localhost:5173 in your browser
npm run dev -- --open

```

I also added a fake API - `getFromApi` for retrieving fake cart and products data. See example in index.svelte for usage. Both include a delay to simulate network loading.

## Work to do

- Display a loading info while the products are in loading state;

- Display a tile for each product with the following infos:

  - Image (as image; you add also e.g.:"?imwidth=175" to the image url to get a 175px wide image, the size 175px is just an example and can be defined based on requirements)
  - Name
  - Base Price (formatted in German Currency format e.g. 1.2 will be "â‚¬1,20")
  - Base Unit

- In the grid the minimum tile width should be 300px with maximum 7 tiles in a row being displayed on screen.
- The tiles should be displayed in a grid and as one column on screens below 480px.
- The layout of the tiles and their content should be optimised for mobile view below 480px and optimised for desktop view above 480px.

- Add a search input field on top that allows filtering the products that contain the input in the product name.

Bonus task:

- use CSS Grid in the layout of tiles;
- Add the count in cart (amount > 0) to the product tile (Note: You have to use the `sku` field to find the matching products);

### Evaluation points

- Use of state management
- Modular component design
- DRY (Reusable code)
- Rendering / Performance / Management of Component lifestyle
- Strong typing and consistent use of Typescript
- General knowledge of CSS and proper use of selector specificity
- Mobile Responsiveness
- Technical explanation of code
- Good Test Coverage using Playwright
- Web accessibility standards are followed
- W3c Standards are followed

### Additional Information

- Even though this project is fairly simple try to organize it like you would do for larger components.
- Your solution should scale with your experience.
- Be prepared to explain your solution and your code in 15 minutes presentation.

- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

_Good luck_
